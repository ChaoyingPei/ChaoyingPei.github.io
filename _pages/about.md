Hello there! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics Engineering at Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE), currently in my fourth year of study. Under the guidance of my esteemed advisor, [Dr. Ran Dai](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=243160), I have the privilege of working in her lab, the [Automation and Optimization Laboratory](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AOL). Prior to joining Purdue, I gained valuable industry experience as an engineer at Baidu Inc, a high-technology company, where I focused on research and development in the field of autonomous driving. Before that, I obtained a bachelor's and master's degree from Beihang University.
